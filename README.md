Assignment A2 for class CSCI3130 for summer 2018.

Please be aware that when I was writing the application, I first wrote the first and second part using Eclipse. I then realized, 
once I got the third part, that I should of been using Android studio the whole time. I removed my previous repository, and 
I re-did parts 1 and 2 using Android Studio. This is why there is very little times between commits, since I had to copy and 
paste what I previously did into Android Studio.
